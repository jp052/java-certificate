Info:

Think of it as transferring contents of one bucket into another. You can always transfer the contents of a smaller bucket to a bigger one. But the opposite is not always possible. You can transfer the contents of the bigger bucket into the smaller bucket only if the actual content in the bigger bucket can fit into the smaller one. Otherwise, it will spill.

It is the same with integral types as well. byte is smaller than short or int. So you can assign a byte to an int (or an int to a float, or a float to a double) without any cast. But for the reverse you need to assure the compiler that the actual contents in my int will be smaller than a byte so let me assign this int to a byte. This is achieved by the cast.
int i = 10;
byte b = 20;
b = i;//will not compile because byte is smaller than int
b = (byte) i; //OK


Further, if you have a final variable and its value fits into a smaller type, then you can assign it without a cast because compiler already knows its value and realizes that it can fit into the smaller type. This is called implicit narrowing and is allowed between byte, int, char, and, short but not for long, float, and double.


final int k = 10;
b = k; //Okay because k is final and 10 fits into a byte

final float f = 10.0;//will not compile because 10.0 is a double even though the value 10.0 fits into a float
i = f;//will not compile.
